child page or subchild page is called, then the application will return to main page 
and then be locked with default or self-defined LockerActivity.

###How To Use###

You can download the src of *LockActivity*, and import it into your workspace as a 
library project, then add it as library into you application, or just merge the files 
into your project (NOT recommended), then *LockActivity* can be used as you wish!

**USE STEP BY STEP**

1.	Create a *Locker Activity*

	*Locker activity* is derived from `com.moonshile.lib.ui.LockerActivity`, which will be
	displayed after your application is locked. To use *Locker Activity*, you shall add an 
	activity, modify its super class to `LockerActivity`, remove the generated layout file 
	so as to use the default layout provided by *LockActivity* library. If you want a self-
	defined layout, just follow the steps as usual. However, it is necessary to emphasize 
	the following tips:

	*	If you create a *Locker Activity* with self-defined layout, the layout must has an
		`EditText` view with id `moonshile_lock_key`, and must also has two buttons with 
		onClick event `onOK` and `onCancel` repectively. If necessary, you need to override
		method `protected boolean rightKey(String)` to define validation process of yourself.
	  
	*	You need to add an attribute in the manifest file to this *Locker Activity* as:

			android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"

2.	Create a *Main Activity*

	*Main Activity* is the activity that the application will return to and then be locked. 
	To achieve this, you NEED to extends `LockedActivity` which has the full name 
	`com.moonshile.lib.ui.LockedActivity`. Then there's two thing you MUST do:

	*	Initialize fileds `key` and `lockerClass` of the super class with the key to unlock your 
		application and the lockerClass you created with super class `LockerActivity` respectively. 
		For example:

			super.key = "";
			super.lockerClass = MyLockerActivity.class;

	*	You must start a sub-activity with `startActivityForResult`, and the sub-activity 
		must extends super class `LockedChildActivity` (will be introduced int the following).
		And then, in your `onActivityResult` method, call `super.onActivityResult(...)` first.
		For example:

			@Override
			public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent){
				super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
				switch(requestCode){
				case REQUEST_CODE_CHILD:
					// TODO ...
					break;
				// TODO ...
				}
				// TODO ...
			}

3.	Create a *Child Activity*

	*Child Activity* is derived from `com.moonshile.lib.ui.LockedChildActivity`. If the application
	is locked, this activity will be finished and return to its father, if its father is also 
	derived from *LockedChidlActivity*, its father activity will also finished, until return to an
	ancestor that is not a *Child Activity*.

	There is nothing but extends the `LockedChildActivity` you need to do to achieve a child 
	activity.

###Q&A###

*	Why merging the files into my project is not recommended ?

	The *LockActivity* library need R class of itself, if you directly merge the files, you need 
	modify some source code manually.
